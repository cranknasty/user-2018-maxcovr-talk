"Gravity with Gravitas and Bar","Peter Lewis","Rowes Lane","This work encompasses two elements - 10 'paper aeroplanes' floating down the face of the building, and a brightly coloured 'bar' running the length of the building. The inspiration for the work is to evoke from passers by a smile as they ponder the vision of over-sized paper aeroplanes floating out of the windows of this beautiful historic building. The whimsical contrast to the work day routine, especially daily commuters passing to and from the Central Railway Station, is the ambition. The 'bar' is designed to draw the eye and 'underline' the aeroplanes. The use of the word 'bar' references the Distinguished Flying Cross and Bar medal awarded for acts of valour, courage or devotion to duty whilst flying in active operations against the enemy. The aeroplanes are larger than life and have a very shiny pure white finish to contrast with the muted colours of the historic facade of the building and its softly uneven brick texture. The aspiration is that passers-by will ponder the possibilities beyond their daily routine, even if only for a moment.","Metal","2014","Ongoing","Permanent","Private (developer contribution via Percent for Art)","Contemporary Art and Architecture Public Art Trail","-27.467873","153.026734"
